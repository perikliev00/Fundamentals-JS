JavaScript Fundamentals

This repository showcases my journey in learning and applying JavaScript. Over time, I’ve implemented a variety of functions and exercises to practice and enhance my understanding of core programming concepts. 
What I’ve Learned
1. Core JavaScript Concepts

    Variables and Data Types: I’ve gained a solid understanding of how to use different types of data (numbers, strings, booleans, objects, arrays) and how to manipulate them.
    Functions: I learned how to write reusable functions that perform specific tasks. This helped me enhance my problem-solving skills by breaking problems into smaller, manageable pieces.
    Control Flow: Through conditional statements (if-else, switch), loops (for, while), and logical operators, I’ve learned how to control the flow of a program based on specific conditions.
    Arrays and Objects: I learned how to work with arrays and objects, including manipulating and accessing values, iterating through them, and using built-in methods for various tasks.
   

2. Mathematical and Logical Problem Solving

    I applied JavaScript to solve mathematical problems, such as calculating areas, determining prime numbers, finding the greatest common divisor, and performing arithmetic operations based on user input.
    This helped me understand how to break down complex problems into smaller steps, ultimately solving them programmatically.

3. Working with Functions and Input Validation

    By creating functions that perform specific tasks, like calculating the cost of fruit based on weight or finding the largest number in a set, I gained a deeper understanding of how to validate inputs, check for edge cases, and ensure that the code works under various conditions.

4. Time and Data Management

    I’ve worked on solving problems related to time, like calculating the time it takes to walk a set number of steps or determining the days in a month, which sharpened my ability to work with dates, times, and perform calculations based on them.

5. Algorithmic Thinking

    Many of the exercises required algorithmic thinking, such as finding common divisors, checking if all digits in a number are the same, and aggregating numbers in an array. These tasks improved my logical thinking and helped me approach problems from an algorithmic perspective.

6. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

    By creating a Dog class and simulating object-oriented behaviors, I learned the basic principles of OOP in JavaScript. This includes defining classes, creating objects, and using methods to interact with object data.

7. Project Structure and Code Organization

    Working on multiple functions and scripts within a single repository taught me how to organize and structure my code effectively. I learned how to separate logic into different files and maintain clean, readable code that is easy to manage and extend.


Skills Gained

    Problem-Solving: I improved my ability to break down complex problems into smaller tasks and solve them step-by-step using JavaScript.
    Function Creation: I became proficient at creating reusable functions for specific tasks and ensuring they handle inputs and outputs correctly.
    Algorithm Development: I developed skills in creating efficient algorithms for mathematical and logical problems.
    Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): I gained hands-on experience with OOP concepts like classes and methods.
    Code Organization: I learned how to structure a codebase with multiple scripts and maintain readability and manageability.

Conclusion

This repository represents a collection of my work as I continue to enhance my JavaScript skills. The variety of problems I solved allowed me to build a diverse set of skills.
